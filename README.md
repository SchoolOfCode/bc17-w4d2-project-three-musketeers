## How to Install the Application

1. Initialse Node Server and Install Express
```terminal
npm init -y
npm install express
```

2. Install nodemon
```terminal
npm install nodemon
```

3. Launch the Server
```terminal
nodemon ./index.js localhost 3000
```
// i added script "start": "nodemon index.js" so we can just type ...npm start ... in terminal to start up the server.

## Remember to use an API Interogator (e.g. POSTMAN)

## If you run into any issues, it's Tom's fault!!!
